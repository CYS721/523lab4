- How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?
- What are the expected work hours for the project? (Not only how many hours, but when do you expect code to be uploaded?)
- How often will group meetings occur?
- Will you have meeting agendas and minutes?  If so, who keeps track of them?  Where are they stored?
- What will be the style of working?  Do you schedule hackathons, or do you set deadlines that teammates need to meet?
- Will you use daily "stand-ups", or submit written summaries of your contributions, or something else?
- What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?
- When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).
- Will you have someone who acts as the project manager (i.e. keeps things on track) for the entire project, or each milestone, or be entirely democratic throughout the project?
- Is there any behaviour you wish to highlight as being expected or unacceptable (i.e., what is the code of conduct for the group?)
- How do you do code review?  Do you pair up, and always review the same person's code, or do you rotate weekly?
- And any other similar things that govern your working relationships.
